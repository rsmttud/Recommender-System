Clustering is an essential data mining tool that aims to discover inherent
 cluster structure in data. For most applications, applying clustering is only
 appropriate when cluster structure is present. As such, the study of
 clusterability, which evaluates whether data possesses such structure, is an
 integral part of cluster analysis. However, methods for evaluating
 clusterability vary radically, making it challenging to select a suitable
 measure. In this paper, we perform an extensive comparison of measures of
 clusterability and provide guidelines that clustering users can reference to
 select suitable measures for their applications.
