Text Clustering is a text mining technique which divides the given set of
 text documents into significant clusters. It is used for organizing a huge
 number of text documents into a well-organized form. In the majority of the
 clustering algorithms, the number of clusters must be specified apriori, which
 is a drawback of these algorithms. The aim of this paper is to show
 experimentally how to determine the number of clusters based on cluster
 quality. Since partitional clustering algorithms are well-suited for clustering
 large document datasets, we have confined our analysis to a partitional
 clustering algorithm.
