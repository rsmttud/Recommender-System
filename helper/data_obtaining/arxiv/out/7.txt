Scaling relations of observed galaxy cluster properties are useful tools for
 constraining cosmological parameters as well as cluster formation histories.
 One of the key cosmological parameters, sigma8, is constrained using observed
 clusters of galaxies, although current estimates of sigma8 from the scaling
 relations of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters are limited by the large
 scatter in the observed cluster mass-temperature (M-T) relation. With a sample
 of eight strong lensing clusters at 0.3 < z <0.8, we find that the observed
 cluster concentration-mass relation can be used to reduce the M-T scatter by a
 factor of 6. Typically only relaxed clusters are used to estimate sigma8, but
 combining the cluster concentration-mass relation with the M-T relation enables
 the inclusion of unrelaxed clusters as well. Thus, the resultant gains in the
 accuracy of sigma8 measurements from clusters are twofold: the errors on sigma8
 are reduced and the cluster sample size is increased. Therefore, the statistics
 on sigma8 determination from clusters are greatly improved by the inclusion of
 unrelaxed clusters. Exploring cluster scaling relations further, we find that
 the correlation between brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) luminosity and cluster
 mass offers insight into the assembly histories of clusters. We find
 preliminary evidence for a steeper BCG luminosity - cluster mass relation for
 strong lensing clusters than the general cluster population, hinting that
 strong lensing clusters may have had more active merging histories.
