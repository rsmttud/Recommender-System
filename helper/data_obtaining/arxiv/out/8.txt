Fuzzy clustering is a famous unsupervised learning method used to collecting
 similar data elements within cluster according to some similarity measurement.
 But, clustering algorithms suffer from some drawbacks. Among the main weakness
 including, selecting the initial cluster centres and the appropriate clusters
 number is normally unknown. These weaknesses are considered the most
 challenging tasks in clustering algorithms. This paper introduces a
 comprehensive review of metahueristic search to solve fuzzy clustering
 algorithms problems.
